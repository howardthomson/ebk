EiffelStudio Bugs -- Feb 2011 at FOSDEM

After adding cluster library/gobo/gobo_all.ecf to the set of clusters, the class
KL_DIRECTORY appears in the 'Groups' tree of accessible classes. but (re-)compilation
reports that KL_DIRECTORY is not a 'known' class !

Removing EIFGEN directory does not fix.

Ensuring validity of $ISE_LIBRARY, $ISE_PRECOMP also does not fix.

Removing gobo_all and adding gobo_kernel results in compilation OK.

-----------------------------------------------

UNIX_FILE_INFO

	update (path), where path refers to a symbolic link, results in an exception !

	The C routine file_stat [$ISE_EIFFEL/C/runtime/file.c] does an lstat into the stat_buf,
	which fails when the symbolic link path exceeds the siae of the stat_buf ... !

is_directory: BOOLEAN recognizes a socket as a directory; faulty implementation ...

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Some crashes ceased after deleting (moving out of sight) ~/.es

KL_DIRECTORY does not recognize a Socket as not being a Directory ...

Updating efb.ecf to change path of a shared library external object, followed by 
'ec -config efb.ecf' and then finish_freezing, the relevant Makefiles etc have not been updated to reflect the new .ecf content ...
